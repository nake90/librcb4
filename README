librcb4

Open source library to control a RCB4-powered robot (like Kondo's KHR-3) from
linux. It has been created using only the official reference manual so it's 100%
free software.

To build simply use `make`. Once compiled link your program using like:
`gcc -L/path/to/librcb4/lib -o my_program my_source.c -lrcb4`
The only header you have to include from your program is rcb4.h.

Check the samples folder for some examples using the library. You can also build
the doxygen documentation executing `make docs` and then read it in your web
browser by opening the file index.html in the doc folder.

You will need a compatible USB to serial adapter connected to the robot. Kondo's
USB to Serial Adapter HS is recommended, but you can use anything that outputs
5V CMOS inverted logic at a speed ranging from 115200bps to 1.25Mbps.
The serial uses 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and even parity.

Also, remember that you need to have permission to read and write into the
device. Usually it's /dev/ttyUSB0, so you can just type ls -al /dev/ttyUSB0 and
see the permissions. You can create an udev rule or just add your user to the
dialout group by issuing as root the following command:
usermod -a G dialout username
You'll have to log out and log in again for the command to take effect.
